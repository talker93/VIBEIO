Media Recording Events
======================
The events which are of interest to record media can all be accessed and subscribed through the :ref:`api_conference`. These :ref:`conf_events` contain information about participants joining and leaving the conference as well as audio and video track events emitted by Webrtc necessary to configure the recording pipelines. These events
will indicate when video or audio tracks have been added or removed from the peer connection and from which peers streams are coming via the same.
The Media Recording Module should set handlers for all of these events via the :cpp:func:`dolbyio::comms::services::conference::add_event_handler` methods.
