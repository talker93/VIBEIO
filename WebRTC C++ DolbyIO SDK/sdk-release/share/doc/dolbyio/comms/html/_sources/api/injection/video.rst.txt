Video
=====
For details about Video Injection please refer to :ref:`vid_frame_handle`. The application must create a :cpp:class:`Video Source <dolbyio::comms::video_source>` and then provide it to the SDK using the 
:cpp:func:`Local Video Service Start <dolbyio::comms::services::local_video::start>` method.

See :ref:`injection_example` for an example of child injection class for all possible media.
