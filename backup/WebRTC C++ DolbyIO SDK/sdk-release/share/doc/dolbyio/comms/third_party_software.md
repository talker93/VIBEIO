separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:

(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and

pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.

The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
openssl-core@openssl.org.

The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
record keeping.)

# License

Most files in FFmpeg are under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
or later (LGPL v2.1+). Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details. Some other
files have MIT/X11/BSD-style licenses. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to
FFmpeg.

Some optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details. None of
these parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to
configure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.

Specifically, the GPL parts of FFmpeg are:

- libpostproc
- optional x86 optimization in the files
    - `libavcodec/x86/flac_dsp_gpl.asm`
    - `libavcodec/x86/idct_mmx.c`
    - `libavfilter/x86/vf_removegrain.asm`
- the following building and testing tools
    - `compat/solaris/make_sunver.pl`
    - `doc/t2h.pm`
    - `doc/texi2pod.pl`
    - `libswresample/swresample-test.c`
    - `tests/checkasm/*`
    - `tests/tiny_ssim.c`
- the following filters in libavfilter:
    - `vf_blackframe.c`
    - `vf_boxblur.c`
    - `vf_colormatrix.c`
    - `vf_cover_rect.c`
    - `vf_cropdetect.c`
    - `vf_delogo.c`
    - `vf_eq.c`
    - `vf_find_rect.c`
    - `vf_fspp.c`
    - `vf_geq.c`
    - `vf_histeq.c`
    - `vf_hqdn3d.c`
    - `vf_interlace.c`
    - `vf_kerndeint.c`
    - `vf_mcdeint.c`
    - `vf_mpdecimate.c`
    - `vf_owdenoise.c`
    - `vf_perspective.c`
    - `vf_phase.c`
    - `vf_pp.c`
    - `vf_pp7.c`
    - `vf_pullup.c`
    - `vf_repeatfields.c`
    - `vf_sab.c`
    - `vf_smartblur.c`
    - `vf_spp.c`
    - `vf_stereo3d.c`
    - `vf_super2xsai.c`
    - `vf_tinterlace.c`
    - `vf_uspp.c`
    - `vsrc_mptestsrc.c`

Should you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the (L)GPL, then
the configure parameter `--enable-version3` will activate this licensing option
for you. Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv3` or, if you have enabled GPL parts,
`COPYING.GPLv3` to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.

There are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:

* The files `libavcodec/jfdctfst.c`, `libavcodec/jfdctint_template.c` and
  `libavcodec/jrevdct.c` are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for
  licensing details. Specifically note that you must credit the IJG in the
  documentation accompanying your program if you only distribute executables.
  You must also indicate any changes including additions and deletions to
  those three files in the documentation.
* `tests/reference.pnm` is under the expat license.


## External libraries

FFmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes
affect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.

### Compatible libraries

The following libraries are under GPL:

When combining them with FFmpeg, FFmpeg needs to be licensed as GPL as well by
passing `--enable-gpl` to configure.

The OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License 2.0. That
license is incompatible with the LGPL v2.1 and the GPL v2, but not with
version 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with FFmpeg, the
license version needs to be upgraded by passing `--enable-version3` to configure.

### Incompatible libraries

There are certain libraries you can combine with FFmpeg whose licenses are not
compatible with the GPL and/or the LGPL. If you wish to enable these
libraries, even in circumstances that their license may be incompatible, pass
`--enable-nonfree` to configure. This will cause the resulting binary to be
unredistributable.

The Fraunhofer FDK AAC and OpenSSL libraries are under licenses which are
incompatible with the GPLv2 and v3. To the best of our knowledge, they are
compatible with the LGPL.

```
libjpeg-turbo Licenses
======================

libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

- The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
  [README.ijg](README.ijg)

  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
  (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)

- The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

  This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
  well as the build system.

- The zlib License, which is listed below

  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
  SIMD extensions.


Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
=========================================

This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
best of our understanding.

1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
    then:

    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
        from the source.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
        - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
        - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
        there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
        simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
        - Clause 2 of the zlib License

    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
        copyright or license text in that file.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License

2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
    if you are distributing an application that statically links with
    libjpeg-turbo, then:

    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

        This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
        Group.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 2 of the IJG license

    2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
        your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
        License.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
    contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

    **Origin**
    - IJG License
    - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
    free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
    consequences resulting from your use of the software.

    **Origin**
    - IJG License
    - Modified BSD License
    - zlib License


The Modified (3-clause) BSD License
===================================

Copyright (C)\<YEAR\> \<AUTHOR\>.  All Rights Reserved.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

- Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,
  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
- Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
- Neither the name of the libjpeg-turbo Project nor the names of its
  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
  software without specific prior written permission.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS",
AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
ARE DISCLAIMED.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF
SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


The zlib License
================

Copyright (C) \<YEAR\>, \<AUTHOR\>.

This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
warranty.  In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
arising from the use of this software.

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
freely, subject to the following restrictions:

1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
   claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software
   in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be
   appreciated but is not required.
2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
   misrepresented as being the original software.
3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.


Why Three Licenses?
===================

The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.
