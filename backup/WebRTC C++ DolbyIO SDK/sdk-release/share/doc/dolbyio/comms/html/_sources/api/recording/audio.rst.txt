Audio
======
#include <dolbyio/comms/media_engine/media_engine.h>

The interface for handling incoming audio frames. Applications must set listener which override the virtual function. The 
:cpp:func:`handle_audio <dolbyio::comms::audio_sink::handle_audio>` function is called with the decoded PCM audio data. When inside a conference the 
C++ SDK will receive a single audio stream which contains the mixed audio of all unmuted participants within that conference. The :cpp:class:`Audio Sink <dolbyio::comms::audio_sink>` must be provided to the SDK using the :cpp:func:`Set Audio Sink <dolbyio::comms::services::media_io::set_audio_sink>` function and this must be done before starting a conference.
